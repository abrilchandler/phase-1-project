to run the json server: `json-server --watch db.json`

## Usage
My 3 event listeners are the dropdown menu, the search bars and the button. 

My db.json has 4 objects wth 4 attributes each, and another 3 objects with 3 attributes each.

My project uses a forEach array iteration to display the searched for horses

In the Find your Horse search bar, we can search for horses in the barn located in the db.json (Presley, George, Franny, Santana).

In the Find your Trainer search bar, search for trainers in the barn located in the db.json (Dustin, Austin, Hunter).

We can utilize Important Dates dropdown menu to explore the vet and farrier scheduled dates for the year.

We have button to display the services the barn offers as well.
