# phase-1-project - Meet The Barn

to run the json server: `json-server --watch db.json`

## Introduction
The Phase 1 Project is meant to be part of a larger project I am working on throughout the Flatiron Bootcamp. This has served as a great first step into identifying what will be useful going forward and what areas I can devote more time to study, in order to improve the user experience. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this page will be part of a larger Barn Manager App or Website. This page allows you to search for the horses that are boarded at the facility and search for the trainers that work out of this facility.

## Project Requirements
My 3 different event listeners are the dropdown menu, the search bars and the button. 

My `db.json`` has 4 objects wth 5 attributes each, and another 4 objects with 3 attributes each.

My project uses a `forEach` array iteration to display the searched for horses

In the Find your Horse search bar, we can search for horses in the barn located in the 'db.json' (Presley, George, Franny, Santana).

In the Find your Trainer search bar, search for trainers in the barn located in the `db.json` (Dustin, Austin, Hunter, John).

I can utilize Important Dates `dropdown` menu to explore the vet and farrier scheduled dates for the year.

I have a Services We Offer button with an `event listener` to display the services the barn offers as well.

I also have the Meet all the Horses button utilizing a `forEach` array iteration method in order to display all the horses in the barn.
